# Make your website with R Markdown in minutes

This is a template (and tutorial) for creating your website with R Markdown in minutes.

The official document from RStudio can be found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).


### The blog part

For now, the 'Blog' link is giving a 404 page. 

If you want to add a static blog to your webpage, go [there](https://github.com/privefl/jekyll-now-r-template).
If you don't, just remove the corresponding 3 lines from `_site.yml`.
